Some people have lost marks in previous courses for not making it easy for their reviewers to give them marks.  
Don’t just make a tidy data set, make it clear to people reviewing it why it is tidy. When you given the variables descriptive names, explain why the names are descriptive.  
Don’t give your reviewers the opportunity to be confused about your work, spell it out to them.
